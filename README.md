# Building An F# Redux Store For C# Xamarin Apps

![Demo of Redux in Action within a Xamarin App](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aspnetde/XamarinReduxDemo/master/demo.gif)

This tiny demo project demonstrates how to implement a basic Redux Store for a C# Xamarin App with the help of F#. For more information about the motivation behind see the [blog post](https://thomasbandt.com/fsharp-redux-store-for-xamarin-apps).

The app is using Xamarin.Forms and supports iOS and Android as target platforms. 

The MVVM Framework in use is [MvvmNano](https://github.com/aspnetde/MvvmNano). Icons are coming from [Icons8](https://icons8.com/). And all the nice people shown as users are provided by [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/). Sorry for the ugly app layout, though ;-).
